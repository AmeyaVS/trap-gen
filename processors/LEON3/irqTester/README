The files contained in this folder are used for testing the interrupt handling capabilities
of the processor. In order to do this, we need to use modified software initialization code
in order to correctly set the exception vectors in addresses 0x110-0x1f0 (analogous to what
done for register windows over/under-flow handlers at addresses 0x50 and 0x60).

The software routine (standard C routine) being called when an interrupt arrives is called
"isrHandler" and it is located in program irqTester.c

File irqGenerator.hpp file contains the hardware module responsible for the interrupt generation:
simply add its include to the main.cpp file of the processor you need to test
and connect it to the correct TLM interrupt port of the processor.
